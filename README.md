# Auto Elytra

Auto Elytra is a client-side mod for forge and fabric which will automatically equip your elytra when you go to fly.

Simply keep a pair of elytra in your inventory and fly like normal! Your chestplate will be automatically un-equiped and re-equiuped when you stop flying.

The mod depends on [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) or [QSL](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) if you're using [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/). If [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) is installed then a configuration menu is accessible through [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or the Forge Mods menu.
